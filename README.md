Python Chess
============

The goal here is to (during my free time at work) make a playable game of chess for two people.
In the future, perhaps there may be an AI opponent or a GUI.

It's presented purely as console input and output, and is a novice foray into OOP.

* Suggestion from the peanut gallery/note to self: use a tool called sonarqube (sonarpython) to give a thorough 'bad practices' check
